## Links

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- clamp

### What I learned

I Learned how to use clamp to make my fonts responsive but also safe by adding limits to my sizes.
I also learned that some images have to have their margins resseted to be properly positioned.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
section h1 {
  font-size: clamp(20px, 5vw, 24px);
  cursor: pointer;
}
```

```css
.author img {
  margin: 0;
  height: 32px;
  width: 32px;
}
```

### Continued development

i would like to conitnue focusing on responsive design and other tools i can use to position elements
